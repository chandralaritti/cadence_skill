# Standard Cell Layout Automation with Cadence Skill

## Overview

This repository contains a Cadence Skill script designed to automate the layout creation for standard cells. The script includes essential logic gates such as:

- **Inverter**
- **NAND**
- **NOR**
- **AND**
- **OR**


The script optimizes placement and routing, greatly enhancing both the efficiency and accuracy of the digital circuit design process.
## Features

- **Automated Layout Generation:** Speeds up the design process by automating the creation of standard cell layouts.
- **Accurate Placement:** Ensures that cells are placed correctly according to design rules.
- **Efficient Routing:** Implements proper routing tracks to minimize errors and optimize layout.

## Future Work

- Expand the script to include more complex cells and logic gates.
- Optimize the routing algorithm for larger designs.
